# ManifestReporter
A simple shell script to automate Munki's manifest building using MunkiReport client data.
## Pre-requisites:
- Munki (https://github.com/munki/munki) and Munki Reports (https://github.com/munkireport/munkireport-php) are both installed.
- Bash is running on the server. This is a bash script
- The person using the script knows how to alter some of the path info, since it's generic here.
- Access to all the accounts, path info, etc needed to run this.
## Caveats, Warnings, etc..
- This script is old, and may not work. I haven't touched it in 10 years because I no longer do this type of work
- This script should absolutely not be run in production without testing, unless you're one of those cowboys.
